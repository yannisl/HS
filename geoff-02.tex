\begin{contractual}[Issued for Construction Drawings]

Further to our previous correspondence Ref:HS-118/HLG/YL/mr/1001, dated August 24, 2013 regarding the issue of ``Issued for Construction Drawings''---and as it appears no definite date has as yet been set for such issuing of drawings---we confirm that in order not to delay the Project, we are proceeding with the development of Shop Drawings, Submittals, Engineering and Procurement activities on the basis of the current design as provided in our Contract.

If there are any sections of the works for which, you are expecting deviations from the current design and you wish us not to proceed with the above, please issue us with your instructions accordingly, in order to avoid the risk of abortive works and consequent claims.
